# Nemo: Intelligent Fish Species Identification & Insights

A lightweight Android application that allows fishermen and marine enthusiasts to instantly identify fish species using a machine-learning model. Simply install the APK, snap a photo of a catch, and see the predicted species — no internet required for on-device inference.

## 📱 App Features

- **Instant Fish Identification**  
  Uses a TensorFlow Lite–optimized MobileNetV2 model to classify fish from a single image in under 3 seconds.

- **Catch History**  
  Stores each identified fish (species, timestamp, location) so users can review their past catches.

- **Real-Time Weather Data**  
  Fetches local weather (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.) at the time of each capture.

- **Nutritional Information**  
  Displays key nutritional facts (calories, protein, fat, etc.) for each identified species.

- **Offline Support**  
  Core classification works without any internet connection.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download & Install**  
   - Grab the latest `Nemo.apk` from the repository.  
   - On your Android device, enable **Install from Unknown Sources** (Settings → Security).  
   - Tap the APK to install.

2. **Run the App**  
   - Open “NEMO” from your app drawer.  
   - **Sign In / Sign Up**:  
     - Use email/password or Google Sign-In (firewall-safe OAuth).  
   - **Grant Permissions**:  
     - Allow camera, location, and storage access when prompted.

3. **Identify a Fish**  
   - From the main screen, tap **“Capture”**.  
   - Snap a clear photo of the fish or pick an existing image.  
   - The app will preprocess & run the image through the ML model.  
   - See the predicted species name and a reference image.

4. **Review Catch History**  
   - Tap **“History”** in the bottom navigation.  
   - Scroll through saved entries (species, date/time, location).  
   - Tap an entry to view weather details and nutritional info.
